# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     - "Task name 1"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  O usuário solicitou duas mudanças principais:
  1. Remover completamente os ícones de instrumentos da tela principal - usuário não precisará mais selecionar instrumentos
  2. Implementar sistema de gravação colaborativa onde cada usuário pode gravar e nomear suas gravações, outros podem ouvir e ensaiar por cima dessas gravações

New collaborative recording system fully functional with all 7 endpoints working correctly. User authentication, room creation/joining, and MongoDB data persistence all working. 15/15 core tests passed (100% success rate). Minor: Song search has external API timeout issues (Spotify/Genius rate limits) but this doesn't affect core functionality."

    message: "✅ COMPLETE FLOW TESTING RESULTS: Successfully tested the full Music Maestro flow. Key findings: 1) User registration and room creation working perfectly 2) Song addition (Yesterday, Imagine, Let It Be) working with lyrics and chords display 3) Simplified tabs showing only 'Letra' and 'Acordes' as requested 4) NO instrument selection system found anywhere 5) Collaborative recording system ('Gravações' button) present and functional 6) Members display correctly without instrument assignments. The app is 100% functional for band/group use with all requested changes implemented. Minor: Some UI elements need data-testid attributes for better testing, but core functionality is perfect."
